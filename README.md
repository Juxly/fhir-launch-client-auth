# FHIR-Client-Auth
A barebones zero dependency library for authorizing smart on fhir apps. This is used with [FHIR-Client.js](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js).
The problem it solves is that on the launch.html page we don't want to pull down the entire [FHIR-Client.js](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-js) library for just a small portion that was being
used to authenticate.
